		"DrunktainOfFaith": "(TH10) MoF but it's trippy",
		"QuickECLReload": "(TH10-TH18.5) Makes ESC + R / restarting a stage update the ECL for it, mainly intended for ECL patch creators. \n Doesn't support: TH06-TH09.5, TH12.8, TH12.5, TH19, TH20tr",
		"SoEWReimuC": "(TH16) Replaces Aya with SoEW ReimuC. To be accurate to SoEW, her focus and unfocus speeds are the same, and you're slow as shit! Credit to TESM for allowing me to use his portrait sprites from MiDI.",
		"Th15SakuyaB": "(TH15) Attempts to recreate DDC SakuyaB in LoLK, with damage... that's somehow better in this game than DDC? She replaces Reisen, bomb is unchanged.",
		"Th15Sukune": "(TH15) Recreates Len'en 3's Sukune in LoLK, comes with a custom bomb aswell. Sukune replaces Sanae. Credit to RosePenguin100 for making the shottype and balancing it!",
		"Th18GrazeCounter": "(TH18) Adds back the graze counter to the HUD in UM, replay compatible. \n Works best with other UM patches that don't edit front.anm and abcard.anm, since this patch edits front.anm to add the Graze sprite to the HUD.",
		"AverageDanmakufuFinal": "(TH14, 14.3, 15, 16, 17, 18) *1280x960 RESOLUTION ONLY* Expands the playable field to fill the entire screen. This patch also adjusts the stages and bosses to use the extended space. Massive credit to Khangaroo for making the original binhacks for this!",
        "YouGrowBigger": "(TH14, 15, 16, 17, 18) You're big now. That's the patch. Applies the You Grow Bigger gimmick for the entire run! This also affects their hitbox, and shottype. Clearing Hard+ with this is probably impossible lmao"
