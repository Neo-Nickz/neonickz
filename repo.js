		"QuickECLReload": "(TH10-TH18.5) Makes ESC + R / restarting a stage update the ECL for it, mainly intended for ECL patch creators. \n Doesn't support: TH06-TH09.5, TH12.8, TH12.5, TH19, TH20tr",
		"SoEWReimuC": "(TH16) Replaces Aya with SoEW ReimuC. To be accurate to SoEW, her focus and unfocus speeds are the same, and you're slow as shit! Credit to TESM for allowing me to use his portrait sprites from MiDI.",
		"Th15SakuyaB": "(TH15) Attempts to recreate DDC SakuyaB in LoLK, with damage... that's somehow better in this game than DDC? She replaces Reisen, bomb is unchanged.",
		"Th15Sukune": "(TH15) Recreates Len'en 3's Sukune in LoLK, comes with a custom bomb aswell. Sukune replaces Sanae. Credit to RosePenguin100 for making the shottype and balancing it!",
		"Th18GrazeCounter": "(TH18) Adds back the graze counter to the HUD in UM, replay compatible. \n Works best with other UM patches that don't edit front.anm and abcard.anm, since this patch edits front.anm to add the Graze sprite to the HUD."
